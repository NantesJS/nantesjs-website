# NantesJS.org

This is the source of the [nantesjs.org](http://nantesjs.org) website.

    http://{Your_GitHub_Username}.github.com/nantesjs-website/

For anything but little fixes, send a `Pull Request` so all the community can agree on it.

## Installation for development

First you will need [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) installed on your machine.

Then simply run :

```bash
yarn start
```

## Add a new meetup

To add a new meetup, you need to create a `.md` file in `datas/meetups/`.

The suggested method is to duplicate the last meetup file and to fill in the fields with the new data.

Don't forget to set the `status` of the previous meetup to `done` for it to be displayed in the previous section.

You could also use [nantesjs-organizer](https://github.com/NantesJS/nantesjs-organizer) to generate the markdown file.
